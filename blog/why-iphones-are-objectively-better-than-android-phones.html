			<p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">It is a common belief that iPhones are objectively better than Android phones, but is this really the case? It's a contentious topic, and ultimately, the decision of which type of phone is better comes down to individual preference. That being said, there are certain factors that may lead someone (me) to conclude that iPhones are superior to Android phones. Here my arguments for why iPhones may be considered objectively better:</p>
			<h5 style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">1. User-friendliness</h5>
			<p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">iOS is generally considered more user-friendly than Android. iPhones are known for their simplicity and ease of use, which may make them a better choice for people who are not particularly tech-savvy. The layout of the home screen and the overall interface is intuitive and straightforward, which makes it easy to navigate and find what you're looking for. Android, on the other hand, can be more complex and may require more time and effort to learn.</p>
			<h5 style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">2. Security</h5>
			<p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">iPhones have a reputation for being more secure than Android phones. This is because Apple controls the hardware and software of its devices, whereas Android devices are made by a variety of manufacturers and use open-source software. This can make Android devices more vulnerable to security threats, as there are more potential entry points for hackers in apps such as Google Store. iPhones also receive regular security updates to fix any vulnerabilities, while some Android devices may not receive updates in a timely manner (if at all).</p>
			<h5 style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">3. Ecosystem</h5>
			<p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">iPhones have a loyal user base and a strong ecosystem. Apple has a large and dedicated customer base that is committed to using its products, including iPhones. This means that there is a strong ecosystem of apps, accessories, and other resources available for iPhones. This can be a major advantage for people who are invested in the Apple ecosystem and want to be able to seamlessly integrate their devices with other Apple products (such as their Mac, Apple Watch and even the outdated iPod).</p>
			<h5 style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">4. Support</h5>
			<p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">iPhones have better support and customer service. Apple is known for its excellent customer service, which can be a major advantage if you have an issue with your device. Apple has a network of physical retail stores where you can go for support, as well as online resources and phone support (although I admit going to an unauthorised repair shop is cheaper). Support for their older Apple devices is also great, as some of their old devices are still heavily compatible with their new software. Android devices, on the other hand, may not have as robust a support system, especially if you have a device from a lesser-known manufacturer. Their phones also lose compatibility faster than iPhones as most of them don't receive the newest software updates after about 3 years.</p>
