        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">Hello. I'm sorry for the long wait for another blog post (that probably no one was waiting for). However, that's mainly because I had to focus on SCHOOL. I like School (for the most part), but sometimes I feel like the teachers are overfocused on our studies and grades, and I really want to rant about it.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">The Singaporean education system is widely regarded as one of the best in the world. It consistently ranks high in international education surveys and is admired for its strong emphasis on academics and high test scores. However, despite its many accolades, I personally do not like the Singaporean education system. Let me explain why.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">First and foremost, I believe that the Singaporean education system places too much emphasis on grades and test scores. Students in Singapore are constantly pressured to achieve high grades and excel in exams. This pressure starts from a very young age for PSLE and continues throughout their school years. While high test scores and good grades are certainly important, the Singaporean education system takes this to an extreme, making grades and test scores the sole measure of success for students.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">This singular focus on grades and test scores creates a highly competitive and stressful environment for students. They are expected to excel in every subject and compete with their classmates for top marks. This competition is further intensified by the fact that students are often sorted into different streams based on their grades, further exacerbating the pressure to perform. Many parents even take the extra step to sign their children up for intensive training classes in order to obtain DSA (Direct School Admission) and to get into special programmes such as the GEP (Gifted Education Programme).</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">Furthermore, the focus on grades and test scores has led to a narrow and rigid curriculum. Students are taught to memorize information such as Mother Tongue essays and regurgitate it in exams, rather than being encouraged to think critically and creatively. This results in a lack of critical thinking skills and a lack of creativity, two essential qualities in today's rapidly changing world.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;"></p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">Additionally, the strict and rigid nature of the Singaporean education system stifles student creativity and innovation. Students are often punished for thinking outside the box and for questioning authority. This creates a culture of conformity, where students are afraid to be different and to challenge the status quo. This lack of creativity and innovation can have long-lasting consequences for the future of the country and its economy.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">Finally, the Singaporean education system is highly centralized, with little room for flexibility or customization. Students are expected to fit into the system, rather than the system being adapted to fit the needs of the students. This can be particularly challenging for students who have learning difficulties, as they are often left behind and not given the support they need to succeed.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">Another major issue with the Singaporean education system is the lack of attention given to students' mental health. The high levels of stress and competition that are a hallmark of the system can take a significant toll on students' mental well-being. Many students struggle with anxiety and depression as a result of the pressure to perform and the fear of not living up to expectations. In fact, the number of suicides among youth aged 10 to 29 in Singapore hit a record high of 112 cases in 2021.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">Despite the increasing recognition of the importance of mental health, the Singaporean education system has yet to implement meaningful measures to address this issue. Most of the time, they just paste some anti-bullying posters on the wall and simply tell students to report any instances of bullying they witness to their teachers, which clearly does not work and never fails to make the bullies' motives even worse than before. Mental health support services are often inadequate and underfunded, and students are often left to cope with their mental health struggles on their own. This can have serious and long-lasting consequences for students, including decreased academic performance, increased risk of substance abuse, and even suicide.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">In conclusion, I believe that the Singaporean education system has many shortcomings, including its narrow focus on grades and test scores, its lack of emphasis on the arts and physical education, its rigid and stifling nature, its unconcern on students' mental health and its lack of customization for individual needs. While the Singaporean education system has produced impressive results in terms of high test scores, it has come at the cost of the overall well-being and development of its students. It is important to remember that education is about more than just grades and test scores, and that we need to create an education system that encourages critical thinking, creativity, and innovation, while also supporting the overall well-being and development of our students.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">End of rant.</p>
