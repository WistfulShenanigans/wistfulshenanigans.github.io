            <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">It is.
            <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">As a long-time Kanye West fan, I must admit that when I was first introduced to Yeezus, I was a bit hesitant to embrace it. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy had always been my favorite Kanye album, and I wasn't sure if this new, raw and abrasive sound was for me. However, upon closer examination, it became clear to me that Yeezus is not only my favourite Kanye album, but also a landmark release in the broader context of modern hip hop and popular music.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">One of the things that initially drew me to Yeezus was its innovative production. Kanye enlisted a diverse array of producers, including Rick Rubin and Hudson Mohawke, to craft a sonic landscape that was unlike anything he had done before. The heavy use of abrasive synths, distorted vocals, and unconventional samples creates a chaotic and jarring sound that is often at odds with traditional hip hop production. One of the reasons I often regard On Sight as the best album opening track by Kanye West ever, mainly because of how he was able jump right into the crazy, grimey and extremely aggressive theme of the album in such a bold way.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">As a fan of Kanye's more polished sound on albums like My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I initially found this departure a bit jarring. However, upon further listens, I began to appreciate the raw, uncompromising nature of the album, and how it challenged the listener in a way that Kanye's earlier work had not. This fearless experimentation not only pushes the boundaries of what is possible within the genre of hip hop, but also serves as a powerful statement about the artist's willingness to take risks and challenge his own artistic conventions. Some examples of this are: On Sight, I Am a God (feat. God), New Slaves, which by the way, the outro had me floating, and In It It.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">In addition to its innovative production, Yeezus also stands out for its lyrics and themes. Kanye tackles a wide range of topics on the album, including race, religion, and relationships, with a level of honesty and vulnerability that is rare in mainstream hip hop. On tracks like New Slaves and Black Skinhead, Kanye addresses the ongoing issues of racial inequality and systemic racism in the United States, using his platform as a celebrity to bring attention to these important issues. At the same time, Kanye also delves into more personal subjects on Yeezus, such as the breakdown of his relationship with ex-girlfriend Amber Rose on Blood on the Leaves (most overrated Kanye West song, by the way), and his complicated feelings about religion and spirituality on I Am a God. These deeply personal lyrics, combined with the album's raw, abrasive sound, create a sense of intimacy and vulnerability that is rare in mainstream hip hop, and helps to make Yeezus one of Kanye's most emotionally resonant releases.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: white;">Despite its controversial reception upon its initial release, Yeezus has proven to be a highly influential album in the years since its release. Its raw, abrasive sound and willingness to tackle difficult themes have inspired a generation of artists to push the boundaries of what is possible within hip hop, and its lasting cultural impact is a testament to its timeless relevance and power. In conclusion, while Yeezus may not have been my first choice when it was first released, I have come to realize that it is not only one of Kanye West's best albums, but also a landmark release in the broader context of modern hip hop and popular music. Its innovative production, emotionally resonant lyrics, and willingness to tackle difficult themes make it a timeless classic that continues to inspire and challenge listeners to this day.</p>
